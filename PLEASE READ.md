# Various_Game_Projects
Various game design projects developed for game design classes. Vary in scale and scope


DnD Assignment 	- 	Helped to streamline the narrative (the narrative itself was thought of
					and written by Michael Siegert). Created the maps and added the trap locations.
					Collaborated directly to think of the tactics and features (such as rewards).
					
XCOM Devolution - 	Pretty much did the whole thing. Thought of the units, wrote up the rules, etc. Only
					thing not done by me was establish the size of the board and playtesting. Relatively 
					small project.
					
SuperPAC		- 	Worked directly on the various unit types and how many resources they costed, how much
					damage they do, and which units they counter. Also thought of the board to keep track
					of who is "winning" the game.
